## üìä **Key Information Displayed**

### **Capture Board Monitoring**
- **Responsive Boards**: Counts boards that are online or have low failure rates
- **Success Rate**: Overall success percentage across all slave boards
- **Master Camera**: CAM1 capture count from master board
- **Total Captures**: Sum of all captures across slave boards

### **IMU Trigger Details**
- **Status**: Shows if IMU is available and enabled (ON/OFF)
- **Monitoring**: Shows if currently monitoring for movement (RUN/IDLE)
- **Threshold**: Movement sensitivity in m/s¬≤ (default: 2.0)
- **Cooldown**: Shows remaining time in minutes (0-30min format)

### **Trigger System Overview**
- **Timer Trigger**: OFF/ON/RUN status
- **IMU Trigger**: OFF/ON/RUN status  
- **GPIO Trigger**: OFF/ON/RUN status with pin number (GPIO16)
- **Web Interface**: Always shows READY when system running

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Changes**

### **master_config.json Updates**
```json
{
  "capture_triggers": {
    "imu_movement_cooldown_seconds": 1800.0,  // 30 minutes
    "gpio_pin20_pin": 16                      // GPIO 16 for trigger
  }
}
```

### **Display Timing**
- **Update Interval**: 3 seconds per screen
- **Total Cycle**: 18 seconds for all 6 screens
- **Special Displays**: Override normal cycling temporarily

## üîç **Real-Time Monitoring Features**

### **Board Health Monitoring**
- Tracks which boards respond successfully to capture commands
- Calculates real-time success rates
- Shows total capture counts across all cameras

### **IMU Cooldown Tracking**
- Displays remaining cooldown time in real-time
- Shows 30-minute timer counting down after movement detection
- Prevents spam triggers from continuous movement

### **Trigger Status Monitoring**
- Real-time status of all trigger systems
- Shows which triggers are active and monitoring
- Displays GPIO pin number for hardware reference

## üéÆ **Usage During Operations**

### **During Photo Sequences**
- OLED temporarily shows sequence progress
- Displays current photo number and total count
- Shows percentage completion
- Indicates how many boards are responding

### **During Individual Captures**
- Shows capture command ID
- Displays master camera status (OK/FAIL)
- Indicates waiting for slave responses

### **During System Startup**
